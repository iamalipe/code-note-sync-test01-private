```Plain
You need to establish a connection between the Safal Subscription and Safal MyBuy applications. In both applications, users should be able to enter their credentials and transfer data seamlessly.

Below are the objectives for this task.

When a user creates an event in Safal Subscription, the same event should be added to Safal MyBuy. Same will happen when user add event in safalmybuy
When a user creates an expense or an item in Safal MyBuy, the summary should be displayed in Safal Subscription.
vents created from Safal Subscription cannot currently be deleted from Safal MyBuy.
When an event is created in Safal MyBuy, it should also be added to Safal Subscription through a checkbox or toggle option. This option should only be visible if the user has entered their ID and password.
This functionality should be managed dynamically within the dynamic menu.
