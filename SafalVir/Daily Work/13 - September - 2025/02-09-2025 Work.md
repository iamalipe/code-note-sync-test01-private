SafalReviews Ad Page Setup Config for Superuser - UI - In Progress




Todays discussion's feedbacks:

1. The drainage entries time zone needs to be corrected based on the users timezone.  
2. Click on the Today's drainage entries should redirect to the drainage tba with filter.  
3. The timezone and time in the Change logs needs to be as per user's time zone.  
4. On profile buttons should be Update or Save.  
5. For profile action there needs to be a change log recorded.  
6. Downloaded report:  
  a. The report should have downloaded or Generated text.  
  b. Page number format should be 1 of 10 page.  
  c. The download time should be of the users and not the UTC.  
  d. Download of record should get recorded in the change logs, if done by nurse then all the related docs to that incident will be notified.  
  e. The downloaded Report should show the images, they can take one page per image. As for large scale images they needs to scaled down.  
  f. In the downloaded report, IDs and Barcode for drainages needs to be shown.  
7. In a incident details view in responsive the Notifications and Field config's UI needs to be fixed to fit the size of the screen.  
8. "Change log" should be renamed to "Activity log".  
9. Need to add check to skip Drainage Type Notification if the values are not set or are zero.  
10. The drainage amount graph should get enlarged to show all patients data.
