Testing Payment recurring with help of stripe subscription simulation

  

i buy plan at 01/01/2025

so next recurring subscription should me 01/02/2025

  

this currently handle by stripe.  
stripe auto change the amount and send our backend a webhook event then based on that event we do our management.  
  
so is this okay to handle this by stripe or we need to handle ?

  

  

Switch at SafalUtilities needs to be

- manage both
- manage vendor side like stripe etc
- manage SafalUtilities side

Remember we are developing a tool or utility and hence it is important to provide options to the users
