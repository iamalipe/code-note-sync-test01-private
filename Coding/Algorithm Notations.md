Algorithm Notations

Asymptotic Notations Asymptotic notations are the mathematical notations used to describe the running time of an algorithm when the input tends towards a particular value or a limiting value. For example: In bubble sort, when the input array is already sorted, the time taken by the algorithm is linear i.e. the best case.

Theta Notation (Θ-notation) Theta notation encloses the function from above and below. Since it represents the upper and the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm, it is used for analyzing the average case complexity of an algorithm.

Big-O Notation (O-notation) Big-O notation represents the upper bound of the running time of an algorithm. Thus, it gives the worst case complexity of an algorithm.

Omega Notation (Ω-notation) Omega notation represents the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm. Thus, it provides best case complexity of an algorithm.
